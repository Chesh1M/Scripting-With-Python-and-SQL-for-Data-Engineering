The most delicious touch was reserved for dessert, however: a chilled bowl of peeled lychee fruit along with, you guessed it. The rose petal perfume of this ravishing Gewurztraminer enveloped the entire table, and was the perfect way to end a perfect meal. From his vines planted in limestone (Boland and Heimbourg crus of Turckheim), Boxler\u2019s R\u00e9serve bottling always has great acidity and an ethereal quality that makes it one of the most noble bottlings of this grape in the world."

This wine comes to its best after several years and can be kept for 20 or 30 years. It can be served in the same manner and with similar dishes as the TRADITION or CHATEAU-CHALON."

        "notes":"The wine is pale yellow with a slightly green tint. Coming from a vintage that could be called solar after the beginning ofripening, this wine has a fresh aromatic nose combining the characteristics of the two grape varieties (grapefruit and apricot). On the palate the attack is round and the expected acidity was able to be maintained thanks to the clay-limestone soil facing north. In mouth, the wine is long and with ageing the unctuous Semillon will continue to fill the mid-palate. This wine is very well-balanced."

        "notes":"The wine shows a bright and clear robe with light green glints. The first nose recalls citrus such as bergamot, lemon, grapefruit. It is enhanced with notes of peach and pear and yellow fruit such as pineapple, peach, and passion. After aeration, the quite reserved wine complexity appears with white flower, lime, lilac and some minerality. The wood is very discreet but brings  a little balsamic touch that well encapsulates the wine on its pastry sweetness. The palate, like his elder Chateau Cheval Blanc, beings quietly, almost shyly, then gradually accelerates to develop good volume, fat and smooth, to an elegant, fresh and distinguished final. Is it a wine where tension, power and dynamism are balanced by an aromatic and persistent freshness of great sophistication."

From the first nose, minerality dominates with its notes of flint, match tip, hit pebble. After aeration, the wine expresses its complexity with fresh citrus notes such as lemon or bergamot. The fresh bush characters like sage or rosemary mingle with notes of fresh flowers such as acacia, lilac or vine flower. The frank and direct attack shows all the nervousness of this wine. The mid- palate is large and crisp. Volume and sweetness balance perfectly with fresh and straight acidity. The aromatic return expresses the complexity of this wine with a fruity white flesh (peach, pear). Its long and rich finish stretches with lovely bitters. "

There were very few bottles of red: my maternal grandfather, who died in 1949, could never explain to him why, because they never knew each other. But it is quite obvious that there has always been a strong \u2018white tradition\u2019 at Saint Cosme. The wines, all of which were pre-1949, were extraordinary according to what my father told me. When he replanted the Le Poste vineyard in 1964, he kept the same proportion of Clairette and Grenache, to perpetuate its history. Our Clairette plantings at Hominis Fides and Le Claux will soon start bearing and write a new chapter in the story of Saint Cosme that we will be able to read together. The application to produce white Gigondas, which we have been supporting for almost 10 years at INAO, is in its final phase. We should reach a successful conclusion in around two years\u2019 time and will finally be able to call Le Poste, along with the other whites produced in Gigondas, \u2018Gigondas\u2019. They deserve nothing less. 2018 was balanced and fresh. The terroir has been properly conveyed and basically, this is a great classic white Le Poste. Flint, fennel, grapefruit."

Although only a stone\u2019s throw from Gigondas, the soils have a much higher proportion of limestone than in Gigondas which makes them uniquely suited to growing white grapes. The results are compelling \u2013 you can sense the limestone and finesse that goes with it. There is a distinctive fabric and it is easy to see the huge potential.

The wine's attack is fresh and full, with richness balanced by an acidity of fine structure and quality. The mid-palate is smooth, showing great volume. Although oak is present, it has become well-incorporated by reducing the excessive barrel aging of previous vintages. This change from the formerly massive style is most welcome. This is a lively wine showing fine mineral character and a good, long finish that is mouthwatering and flavorful\u2014it is the type of wine which makes you want another glass. The 2005 vintage is well-known for its red wines, but the whites offer immense pleasure, too.

        "notes":"Winemaker Pierre Vincent (formerly of Maison Jaffelin) declared that 2009 was a \"quasi-perfect vintage and the only reason I say 'quasi-perfect' is because we had some early season hail in Bonnes Mares, Chambolle and Charmes-Chambertin. The growing season was like 2005 that gave us very ripe tannins and round and supple acidities. The flowering was perfect, which made for a large crop with uniform ripeness levels. And because the growing season didn't have much rot pressure, the fruit was super clean and our sorting losses were less than 5%. We began picking on the 8th of September and started with the whites before moving on to the reds. The fruit averaged 13% in terms of potential alcohol and there wasn't even one wine that I decided to chaptalize, which is extremely rare. The vinification was easy even though I did a relatively long cuvaison of 25 to 28 days at a maximum temperature of 30\u00b0 C. As I did in 2008, I used varying percentages of whole clusters, which I think added elegance. The malos were irregular with some beginning early and finishing late and some started late but finished quickly. The post-malo pHs were in the 3.65 range, which is perfectly acceptable to us. Overall, we are extremely happy with the potential quality of our '09s and believe that our clients are going to love them.\" As I have observed previously, Vincent is making real progress and these '09s are easily the best wines I have yet seen from him, which is a real compliment as the '08s were excellent. Moreover, several of the villages level wines offer truly outstanding quality and should be on your radar screens for obtaining great value."

        "notes":"The quality of this white really took off with the acquisition of a pneumatic press and cooling system in 2009--and the wine has never looked back. Traditionally, Marcoux's white is an unusual blend (in the sense that it was heavily Roussanne dominant) of 60% Roussanne and 40% Bourboulenc hailing from two parcels. The Roussanne's 0.5-hectares of vines in Les Esqueirons where the cool limestone-based soils are perfect for white grapes (bringing freshness, texture and finesse) and the Bourboulenc, a 0.35-hectare plot in Les Bosquets (this variety bringing more citric freshness and drive). From 2015, due to demand for this cuv\u00e9e, Sophie Armenier has been vinifying and blending in Marcoux's white varieties that grow on their 'red' vineyards--Grenache Blanc and Clairette. Pre-2015 these grapes were co-fermented with the estate Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape rouge. Hence, the new blend looks something like this: Roussanne (55%; bringing the power), Bourboulenc (35%; freshness) and Grenache Blanc\/Clairette (10%; flesh and finesse). The grapes are whole-berry pressed, naturally fermented and raised entirely in steel vat on fine lees. There is no b\u00e2tonnage and the malo is blocked to further underline the wine's structure and freshness. It's the kind of racy, juicy white that we wished the appellation made more of (and that we had more of!)."

The range of flavours, in line with that of the nose, shows a dominant of exotic fruits (banana, mango), spices (ginger, Sichuan  pepper) and flowers (peony). We can taste a delicate varietal bitterness. The finish has a good length, 8-9 caudalies, with a frank liveliness and a persistent bitterness. The balance of this wine is very tasty. A bit powerful, it keeps the delicacy and the brightness of this very beautiful grape variety."

        "notes":"Enrico Serafino \"Grifo del Quartaro\" Gavi di Gavi is a classic example of Piedmont's noble white wine made from the native Cortese grape. Gavi DOCG is the most esteemed source of Cortese wines and the town of Gavi, at its heart, is recognized to produce the finest expressions of the denomination. Thanks to the sloping hills and exposure, as well as marly, white chalky and clay-rich earth, the area creates wines with clear-cut character, freshness, and minerality, as well as complex structure. The name Grifo del Quartaro refers to an antique coin used by Genovese Lords (from the city of Genoa that is not far from the village of Gavi), who were the vineyard land-owners of the Gavi area. "

With an ethereal aroma that alone is worth the price of a bottle, this fills the nostrils and imagination with myriad flowers, pit fruits, citrus, tropical fruits. Waxy rather than creamy in texture, and almost nobly rich in its honeyed way, with effusive ripe quince, banana and pink grapefruit tinged with salt and chalk, this cuvee finishes with purity, penetration, and remarkable persistence.\""

Traditionally it has been vinified as a demi-sec wine, and Fran\u00e7ois Chidaine seems willing to continue in that direction. The soil consists of deep clay and limestone over a subsoil of tuffa, the bedrock in the area from which the deep cellars are carved and out of which the villages are built. It is porous and provides water to the vines in even the driest of summers. The average age of the vines is fifty years and they yield only 20 hectoliters per hectare. Harvesting done manually in several passes through the vineyard. Chidaine never chaptalizes wines that will finish with residual sugar. This wine shows notes of quince, pears and spring blossoms in the nose. In the mouth it is very rich, but with nice balance. "

This is a dry wine that is also fresh and lovingly thirst-quenching on the palate.

As bee keepers started to set up their bee-hives, the area became known as \"Clos des Mouches\" (i.e. the Enclosure of the Honey Bees).  Clos des Mouches white is a generous wine combining the body of Corton Charlemagne and the elegance of Montrachet. Its hue is bright, limpid, and pale golden. It has an elegantly perfumed nose of smoky citrus with tinges of vanilla. On the palate, the aromas are reminiscent of honey, almond, lemon and, as the wine gets older, grilled almonds.  It needs at least two years in bottle to fully develop and can last 8 to 12 years."

        "notes":"A project by Marco de Grazia, named for his daughter Elena (Eli), that donates a large portion of the proceeds to a children's hospital in Florence. The labels are drawings by Elena. This is 100% Carricante from Mount Etna. Vinified in stainless steel vats through cold maceration and aged in 10lh barrell and tonneaux for 10 months, last passage in bottle for further 8 months. Straw yellow colour, it shows delicate orange blossom and a dainty touch of white flower, lime wood and vanilla on the nose, sapid on the palate. Fish, flesh or foul, all are fine, if very gently cooked. It loves seafood, particularly over pasta: after all, it is Sicilian. "

        "notes":"The opening to the nose ranges from banana to candied citron, compositional grapes, accompanied by a spicy kick aptly presented by toasted oak. The entire nose-taste sensation transmits a dense texture to the palate, rich and candied, with great balance and elegance. A long finish slowly thins out with great pleasantness. Food accompaniments: great international cuisine, fondue and flan, fish, foie gras, fatty and blue cheeses."
